<h2>Understand risks, threats, and vulnerabilities</h2>

When security events occur, you’ll need to work in close coordination with others to address the problem. Doing so quickly requires clear communication between you and your team to get the job done.

Previously, you learned about three foundational security terms:

    Risk: Anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset

    Threat: Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets

    Vulnerability: A weakness that can be exploited by a threat

These words tend to be used interchangeably in everyday life. But in security, they are used to describe very specific concepts when responding to and planning for security events. In this reading, you’ll identify what each term represents and how they are related.
### Security risk

Security plans are all about how an organization defines risk. However, this definition can vary widely by organization. As you may recall, a risk is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. Since organizations have particular assets that they value, they tend to differ in how they interpret and approach risk.

One way to interpret risk is to consider the potential effects that negative events can have on a business. Another way to present this idea is with this calculation:

### Likelihood x Impact = Risk

For example, you risk being late when you drive a car to work. This negative event is more likely to happen if you get a flat tire along the way. And the impact could be serious, like losing your job. All these factors influence how you approach commuting to work every day. The same is true for how businesses handle security risks.

In general, we calculate risk in this field to help:

    Prevent costly and disruptive events

    Identify improvements that can be made to systems and processes

    Determine which risks can be tolerated

    Prioritize the critical assets that require attention

The business impact of a negative event will always depend on the asset and the situation. Your primary focus as a security professional will be to focus on the likelihood side of the equation by dealing with certain factors that increase the odds of a problem.
### Risk factors

As you’ll discover throughout this course, there are two broad risk factors that you’ll be concerned with in the field:

    Threats

    Vulnerabilities

The risk of an asset being harmed or damaged depends greatly on whether a threat takes advantage of vulnerabilities.

Let’s apply this to the risk of being late to work. A threat would be a nail puncturing your tire, since tires are vulnerable to running over sharp objects. In terms of security planning, you would want to reduce the likelihood of this risk by driving on a clean road.
### Categories of threat

Threats are circumstances or events that can negatively impact assets. There are many different types of threats. However, they are commonly categorized as two types: intentional and unintentional.

For example, an intentional threat might be a malicious hacker who gains access to sensitive information by targeting a misconfigured application. An unintentional threat might be an employee who holds the door open for an unknown person and grants them access to a restricted area. Either one can cause an event that must be responded to.
### Categories of vulnerability

Vulnerabilities are weaknesses that can be exploited by threats. There’s a wide range of vulnerabilities, but they can be grouped into two categories: technical and human.

For example, a technical vulnerability can be misconfigured software that might give an unauthorized person access to important data. A human vulnerability can be a forgetful employee who loses their access card in a parking lot. Either one can lead to risk.

<h2>The emergence of cloud security </h2>

One of the most significant technology developments this century has been the emergence of cloud computing. The United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre defines cloud computing as, “An on-demand, massively scalable service, hosted on shared infrastructure, accessible via the internet.”

Earlier, you learned that most information is in the form of data, which is in a constant state of change. In recent years, businesses started moving their data to the cloud. The adoption of cloud-based services has complicated how information is kept safe online. In this reading, you’ll learn about these challenges and the opportunities they’ve created for security professionals.

### Soaring into the cloud

Starting an online business used to be a complicated and costly process. In years past, companies had to build and maintain their own internal solutions to operate in the digital marketplace. Now, it’s much easier for anyone to participate because of the cloud.

The availability of cloud technologies has drastically changed how businesses operate online. These new tools allow companies to scale and adapt quickly while also lowering their costs. Despite these benefits, the shift to cloud-based services has also introduced a range of new cybersecurity challenges that put assets at risk.
Cloud-based services

The term cloud-based services refers to a variety of on demand or web-based business solutions. Depending on a company’s needs and budget, services can range from website hosting, to application development environments, to entire back-end infrastructure.

There are three main categories of cloud-based services:

    Software as a service (SaaS)

    Platform as a service (PaaS)

    Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

### Software as a service (SaaS)
SaaS refers to front-end applications that users access via a web browser. The service providers host, manage, and maintain all of the back-end systems for those applications. Common examples of SaaS services include applications like Gmail™ email service, Slack, and Zoom software.
### Platform as a service (PaaS)
PaaS refers to back-end application development tools that clients can access online. Developers use these resources to write code and build, manage, and deploy their own apps. Meanwhile, the cloud service providers host and maintain the back-end hardware and software that the apps use to operate. Some examples of PaaS services include Google App Engine™ platform, Heroku®, and VMware Cloud Foundry. 
### Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
IaaS customers are given remote access to a range of back-end systems that are hosted by the cloud service provider. This includes data processing servers, storage, networking resources, and more. Resources are commonly licensed as needed, making it a cost-effective alternative to buying and maintaining on premises.

Cloud-based services allow companies to connect with their customers, employees, and business partners over the internet. Some of the largest organizations in the world offer cloud-based services:

    Google Cloud Platform

    Microsoft Azure

### Cloud security

Shifting applications and infrastructure over to the cloud can make it easier to operate an online business. It can also complicate keeping data private and safe. Cloud security is a growing subfield of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on the protection of data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud.

In a traditional model, organizations had their entire IT infrastructure on premises. Protecting those systems was entirely up to the internal security team in that environment. These responsibilities are not so clearly defined when part or all of an operational environment is in the cloud.

For example, a PaaS client pays to access the resources they need to build their applications. So, it is reasonable to expect them to be responsible for securing the apps they build. On the other hand, the responsibility for maintaining the security of the servers they are accessing should belong to the cloud service provider because there are other clients using the same systems.

In cloud security, this concept is known as the shared responsibility model. Clients are commonly responsible for securing anything that is directly within their control:

    Identity and access management

    Resource configuration

    Data handling

Note: The amount of responsibility that is delegated to a service provider varies depending on the service being used: SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS.
### Cloud security challenges

All service providers do their best to deliver secure products to their customers. Much of their success depends on preventing breaches and how well they can protect sensitive information. However, since data is stored in the cloud and accessed over the internet, several challenges arise:

    `Misconfiguration` is one of the biggest concerns. Customers of cloud-based services are responsible for configuring their own security environment. Oftentimes, they use out-of-the-box configurations that fail to address their specific security objectives.

    `Cloud-native breaches` are more likely to occur due to misconfigured services.

    `Monitoring access might` be difficult depending on the client and level of service.

    `Meeting regulatory standards` is also a concern, particularly in industries that are required by law to follow specific requirements such as HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR.

Many other challenges exist besides these. As more businesses adopt cloud-based services, there’s a growing need for cloud security professionals to meet a growing number of risks. Burning Glass, a leading labor market analytics firm, ranks cloud security among the most in-demand skills in cybersecurity.
